# Computer Architechture

## CPU

Actual 'computing' bit. Performs calculations. All the 'smarts' live here. It doesn't understand Ruby, it understands Assembly. Assembly is horrible to write, but a compiler/interpreter translates our programs to Assembly.

## Memory

Stores values during calculations. Usually stored in RAM [Random Access Memory]. 

Another type of memory is the registers. RAM is very quick, but is slower than the rate the CPU works at (millions of operations per second, compared to billions). Registers are the CPU's own memory which it can access very quickly. 

## Hard disk storage

RAM does not persist when the computer turns off. Data is stored to a hard disk so that it survives a process cycle.
